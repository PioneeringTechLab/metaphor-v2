# Metaphor V2

This is a custom Bootstrap 4 theme with CSUN branding.


## What this project does

This repository includes a project structure with a build script that builds a custom CSS version of Bootstrap 4, using Gulp. You can
clone this repository, run the Gulp task and go right into modifying variables and adding styles. There's also an HTML file that contains
a neatly organized collection of Bootstrap components that fit a 1920x1080 display, so you can instantly see the outcome. 
There is also ALL of the bootstrap documentation included in the /docs directory. As you make changes to bootstrap default styles, you can see the changes take affect on various pages in the docs. 



## Prerequisites
